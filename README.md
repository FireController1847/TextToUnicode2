# TextToUnicode2

This is the sequel to [TextToUnicode](https://github.com/FireController1847/TextToUnicode), which uses better practices and revised internals with a more robust and interactive conversion process.

As before, this is still a development utility to convert strings of text into MASM x64 variables, but with a revised format and process.

It's still not perfect, and I'm sure there is a lot of room for improvement, but as I learn more about Assembly x64 and the x86-64 CPU Instruction Set, I feel I am becoming better at writing things like these. I'm excited to see where I can take this knowledge into the future.
